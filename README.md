This repository is a dedicated space for my learning and practice in the **Programming Techniques** discipline at the Federal University of CearÃ¡ (UFC), with a strong focus on **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

---

## Repository Objective

The main goals of this repository are:

* **Document progress:** To record the concepts, exercises, and projects developed throughout the course.
* **Serve as a reference:** To maintain an organized collection of solutions and code examples for future consultation.
* **Share knowledge:** To provide a resource for other students who are learning the same topics.

## Topics Covered (and In Progress)

The Programming Techniques discipline covers various Java and OOP concepts. Here are the topics that have been (or will be) explored in this repository:

* **Java Fundamentals:** Variables, data types, operators, control structures (if/else, switch, loops), arrays.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
    * Classes and Objects
    * Encapsulation (getters and setters)
    * Inheritance and Polymorphism
    * Abstraction (abstract classes and interfaces)
    * Composition vs. Inheritance
* **Java Collections:** `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, `Iterator`.
* **Exception Handling:** `try-catch`, `finally`, `throws`, custom exceptions.
* **Input/Output (I/O):** Basic file reading and writing.
* **Maven:** Project and dependency management.
